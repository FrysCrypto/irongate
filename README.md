# Irongate

**Enterprise-Grade Multi-Layer Network Isolation System**

Irongate is a sophisticated network security tool that enforces strict device separation on standard network infrastructure—without requiring managed switches or VLANs. It implements eight layers of defense-in-depth isolation to prevent unauthorized device communication on your network.

## Overview

Many organizations need to isolate critical devices (servers, medical equipment, IoT devices, etc.) but lack access to managed switches with VLAN capabilities. Irongate solves this by becoming a software-based network intermediary that controls all traffic through multiple overlapping security layers.

### Key Features

- **8 Layers of Protection** - Defense-in-depth approach ensures isolation even if one layer is bypassed
- **No Special Hardware Required** - Works on standard unmanaged network infrastructure
- **Two Isolation Modes** - Single-NIC (software-based) or Dual-NIC (hardware-enforced) isolation
- **Web-Based Management** - Modern HTTPS dashboard for real-time monitoring and device management
- **Zone-Based Security** - Classify devices into quarantine, isolated, servers, or trusted zones
- **Active Threat Detection** - Real-time monitoring for bypass attempts with automatic response

## How It Works

Irongate implements eight complementary layers of network isolation:

### Layer 1: DHCP Microsegmentation
- Assigns /30 subnets to isolated devices, forcing all traffic through Irongate
- Uses DHCP Option 121 (Classless Static Routes) to capture all traffic
- Short lease times ensure continuous control over device network configuration
- Separate isolated DHCP pool (10.55.0.0/16) for managed devices

### Layer 2: ARP Defense
- Continuous ARP cache management to claim device gateway MACs
- Immediate response to ARP requests prevents spoofing
- Detects bypass attempts using static ARP entries
- Aggressive re-poisoning when bypass detected (500ms intervals)

### Layer 3: IPv6 Router Advertisement Control
- Controls IPv6 router advertisements in dual-stack networks
- Pushes custom IPv6 prefix (fd00:iron:gate::/64)
- Leverages IPv6 preference in modern systems to route traffic through Irongate

### Layer 4: nftables Stateful Firewall
- Kernel-level packet filtering with connection tracking
- Per-device zone classification with customizable policies
- Rate limiting for new connections
- Comprehensive logging of dropped packets

### Layer 5: Active Bypass Detection & Response
- Real-time monitoring for unauthorized connection attempts
- TCP RST injection to terminate bypass connections
- ICMP unreachable responses for UDP bypass attempts
- Security event logging for auditing

### Layer 6: Gateway Takeover
- Bidirectional ARP management (gateway sees all devices at Irongate's MAC)
- CAM table management to control switch forwarding behavior
- Gateway MAC coordination to win Layer 2 arbitration
- Promiscuous packet interception for stateful validation

### Layer 7: ARP Reply Interception
- Real-time monitoring of all ARP traffic on the network
- Intercepts ARP replies from protected devices announcing their real MAC addresses
- Immediately counters with spoofed replies to maintain isolation
- Prevents Layer 2 bypass attempts by untrusted devices
- Selective enforcement: allows trusted devices, gateway, and servers to communicate normally

### Layer 8: Algorand Blockchain Verification (Optional)
- Provides 100% VLAN-equivalent protection via cryptographic device authentication
- Stores authorized devices in an immutable on-chain registry on Algorand blockchain
- Verifies device identity via cryptographic signatures before allowing access
- Devices must be registered on-chain to access protected resources
- Integrates with Layers 1-7 for defense-in-depth (falls back to standard protection if blockchain unavailable)
- Configurable caching for performance optimization
- Optional audit logging for compliance and security forensics
- Requires deploying a smart contract and configuring the app_id in config

## System Requirements

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|--------------|
| Operating System | Linux (Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora/CentOS/RHEL) |
| Kernel Version | 4.18+ (for nftables and bridge port isolation) |
| Memory | Minimum 512MB RAM |
| Privileges | Root/sudo access required |
| Network | At least one network interface (two for Dual-NIC mode) |

## Installation

### Quick Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/FrysCrypto/irongate.git
cd irongate

# Make installer executable
chmod +x irongate_installer.sh

# Run installation (requires root)
sudo ./irongate_installer.sh
```

### Post-Installation

After installation, Irongate creates:
- Configuration: `/etc/irongate/irongate.yaml`
- Logs: `/var/log/irongate/`
- Device database: `/var/lib/irongate/zones/devices.yaml`
- Web interface: `https://localhost:8443`

## Configuration

The main configuration file is located at `/etc/irongate/irongate.yaml`:

```yaml
network:
  interface: eth0              # Primary network interface
  gateway_ip: 192.168.1.1      # Network gateway IP
  isolated_network: 10.55.0.0/16

security:
  zones:
    - quarantine   # New/unknown devices
    - isolated     # Devices requiring isolation
    - servers      # Protected server zone
    - trusted      # Trusted devices with full access
```

### Isolation Modes

**Single-NIC Mode (Default)**
- Software-based multi-vector isolation
- ~95% effective (subject to timing race conditions)
- Suitable for most use cases

**Dual-NIC Mode**
- Hardware-equivalent VLAN isolation via Linux bridge port isolation
- 100% kernel-enforced isolation
- Requires additional USB ethernet adapter

### Layer 8 Blockchain (Optional)

To enable Layer 8 Algorand blockchain verification for 100% VLAN-equivalent protection:

1. Install the Algorand SDK: `pip install py-algorand-sdk`
2. Deploy the smart contract: `python3 /opt/irongate/smart_contract.py`
3. Configure blockchain in `/etc/irongate/irongate.yaml`:

```yaml
blockchain:
  enabled: true
  network: "mainnet"       # mainnet, testnet, or betanet
  app_id: YOUR_APP_ID      # From smart contract deployment
  cache_ttl: 60            # Cache duration in seconds
  fallback_allow: true     # Allow access if blockchain unavailable
  audit_logging: false     # Enable for compliance logging
```

4. Register devices using the CLI: `irongate-blockchain register`

## Usage

### Starting/Stopping Services

```bash
# Start Irongate

## Security Considerations

- **Root Access Required**: Irongate requires root privileges for network manipulation
- **Network Disruption**: Misconfiguration can disrupt network connectivity
- **Testing Recommended**: Test in a lab environment before production deployment
- **Backup Configuration**: Always backup network settings before installation
- **Firewall Rules**: Irongate modifies nftables rules; existing rules may be affected

## Use Cases

- **Medical Device Isolation**: Protect sensitive medical equipment from network threats
- **IoT Segmentation**: Isolate IoT devices from critical infrastructure
- **Server Protection**: Create isolated zones for sensitive servers
- **Guest Network Isolation**: Separate guest devices from internal resources
- **Legacy System Protection**: Isolate legacy systems that cannot be patched

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Devices not receiving DHCP leases**
- Verify the network interface is correct in `/etc/irongate/irongate.yaml`
- Check that Irongate services are running: `systemctl status irongate-engine`

**Web interface not accessible**
- Ensure port 8443 is not blocked by external firewall
- Check web service status: `systemctl status irongate-web`

**Isolation not working**
- Review security logs: `tail -f /var/log/irongate/security.log`
- Verify all layers are enabled in configuration
- Consider switching to Dual-NIC mode for complete isolation
- Enable Layer 8 blockchain verification for 100% VLAN-equivalent protection
